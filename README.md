Common compressible flows are implemented here. Isentropic flow relations, normal shocks, oblique shocks, Prandtl-Meyer expansion, area relations for isentropic flow and so on. There is also a little bit of ideal gases and unit conversion that has also been written here. To build, invoke the make command.
